PROBLEM #3: Bairstows Method
Write a C program to implement Bairstow&#39;s Method.
Your program should:
1. Prompt the user for the degree of the polynomial (minimum 2, maximum 5).
2. Prompt the user to enter the coefficients of the polynomial and the tolerance for
convergence.
3. Output the iteration tables for the first, middle, and last set of iterations, followed by all
the roots of the polynomial.
